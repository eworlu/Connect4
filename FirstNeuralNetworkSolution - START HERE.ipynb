        "This free tutorial is intended for anyone curious about building their own A.I. projects. In this tutorial, you will build a neural network from scratch and train it to make Lemonade sales predictions using a simple, synthetic dataset.   You will be introduced to PyTorch, a deep learning library managed by Meta's AI group, powering lots of A.I. applications around the world today.\n",
